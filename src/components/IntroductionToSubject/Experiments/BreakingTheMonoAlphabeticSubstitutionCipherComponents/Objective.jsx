            <p>The primary objective of this experiment is to underscore the notion that having a large keyspace, while essential for cryptographic security, is not the sole determining factor in achieving secure encryption. Through this experiment, we aim to explore the following key points:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Evaluate Key Space Size:</strong> We will examine the concept of a large keyspace and its importance in encryption. This involves understanding how increasing the number of possible keys makes it more difficult for attackers to perform exhaustive search attacks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Introduce Vulnerabilities:</strong> Despite a large keyspace, we will demonstrate that certain encryption methods can still be vulnerable to attacks. In particular, we will focus on the mono-alphabetic substitution cipher, a classical example with a vast keyspace that remains insecure due to its inherent characteristics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Highlight Cryptanalysis:</strong> We will emphasize the role of frequency analysis as a cryptanalysis technique. By analyzing the frequency of characters in the ciphertext, we will show how attackers can exploit patterns, even in ciphers with large keyspaces, to decrypt messages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Emphasize Holistic Security:</strong> This experiment will emphasize the need for holistic security measures, including the choice of robust encryption algorithms, in addition to a large keyspace. We will demonstrate that a strong encryption method should withstand various cryptographic attacks, not just brute-force attacks.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>By achieving these objectives, participants will gain a comprehensive understanding of the limitations of a large keyspace and the importance of employing encryption methods that are resistant to common cryptanalysis techniques, ultimately contributing to the broader knowledge of cryptography and data security.</p>
