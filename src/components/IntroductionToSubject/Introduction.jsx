                Welcome to the Cryptography Lab!
                In this virtual laboratory, we embark on a journey
                to explore the fundamental mathematical underpinnings
                of cryptography, gain hands-on experience with core cryptographic
                applications, and hone our skills in designing and analyzing information
                security protocols. Our mission is to equip you with a deep understanding
                of cryptography's basic principles and their real-world applications.
                Join us on this educational adventure and immerse yourself in the world
                of secure communication and data protection.
